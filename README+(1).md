## General Information
This project focusses on helping out a Bike rental platform named "Boom Bikes" in chalking out strategies to improve their sales and hence 
the revenue. They saw a dip in their revenue due to COVID and hence want us to understand their data , analyse it and apply machine learning algorithms and chalk out how they can improve their sales/revenue. 

The dataset being utilised here is the day.csv which contains categorically divided data for the rentals for the years 2018 and 2019. 

## Conclusions
➢ Fall season attracts more hired rentals for bikes than in all other seasons.
➢ There is a steep rise in the count of bike rentals from the year 2018 to 2019. 
➢ Most number of rentals are in the months from May to Sep. Highest peaks were 
observed during the plotting of the histogram. 
➢ When its not an holiday people tend to hire lesser bikes so we can infer that the 
people hire slightly more bikes on holidays in lieu of spending personal time and 
enjoyment. 
➢ Clear weather attracts more number of rentals rather than misty or light rainy 
scenarios. 
➢ Low temp and high windspeed attracts less rentals as people don’t want to ride 
bikes on hard/cold weather days. 
➢ The working day/ non-working day seems to have no impact on the rental numbers. 
➢ Thursday , Friday and the weekends attracted more number of rentals than other 
days of the week.
